# ðŸŒŠðŸŒŠðŸŒŠ Hochwasser ðŸŒŠðŸ¤½ðŸŒŠ
Highly efficient client for [Pixelflut]:
Faster than [sturmflut]!

Can currently only send a single picture though.

## benchmark
The following benchmark was run on a max-spec X280 against version [d4c574b].

I could not figure out what the performance bottleneck is, but it is not CPU limited.

To reproduce, run the following commands in separate shells:

```sh
iperf -s -p 1337
go run main.go -image benchmark/test.png -connection 10
```

![screenshot: 55 Gbps of hochwasser](benchmarks/benchmark_x280.png)

55 Gbps on average! ðŸŒŠðŸŒŠðŸŒŠ

[sturmflut] (`./sturmflut 127.0.0.1:1337 benchmark/test.png -t 10`, version `8ec6ee9`) managed to get 48 Gpbs throughput on this system.

> Hint: Benchmarking throughput against the [pixelnuke][pixelflut_gh] is pointless,
  as performance is then CPU-limited to ~1 Gbps by the server.
  Using [iperf] removes the server limitation.
